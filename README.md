# discourse-larger-long-image

Discourse often scales images to a suitable size and puts them into beautiful lightboxes.  But this becomes a side effect on the sometimes long images that can appear.  The long image is stretched into a slim 41x500 pxÂ² strip.

This theme component will apply stretching to images with an aspect ratio greater than 2:1 so that they fill the width of the post.
